Mirrors

Every motor vehicle subject to registration in California is required by law to be equipped with not less than two mirrors, including one affixed to the left hand side, located so as to reflect to the driver a view of the highway for a distance of at least 200 feet to the rear of such vehicle. You should properly adjust your mirrors before starting to drive, to avoid being distracted while attempting to adjust them during driving.

Maintaining good visibility requires that you keep windshields and mirrors clean and free from obstructions. If your windshield is cracked and obstructs your view or that of your passenger, you will not be allowed to take your driving test. You must not carry objects, inside or outside, which obscure your view.

In some cases, a mirror is required on both the right and left sides of the vehicle for visibility reasons. For example, if a vehicle is carrying a load or is built in such a way that the driver's view to the rear is obstructed, a mirror on right of the vehicle is required in addition to the mirror on the left. Likewise, both side mirrors are required if the view to the rear is obstructed when a vehicle is towing another vehicle or load. The only time the right mirror is not required under similar circumstances is when the vehicle is a passenger vehicle and the obstructing load consists of passengers. Lastly, buses and trolley coaches are required to have both a left and right mirror at all times.
