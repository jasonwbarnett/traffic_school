Horn

Vehicles are required to have a functioning horn or similar audible warning device. While the noise level of your horn must not be excessive, it must be audible under normal driving conditions for at least 200 feet from your vehicle.

It is appropriate to sound your horn:

    To avoid accidents by alerting other drivers to your presence.
    On narrow mountain roads when you cannot see 200 feet ahead while driving as far right as possible.

It is not appropriate to sound your horn:

    Because someone is driving slowly
    To chastise other drivers who have made a mistake
    Because you are angry
    When by slowing or stopping you can avoid the dangerous situation
    For any other reason, except to help avoid an accident
