Tires

The minimum legal tread depth for tires is 1/32 of an inch for most passenger vehicles, 4/32 of an inch for buses, most trucks, and most trailers, and is 6/32 of an inch for snow tires. To avoid skidding, blowouts, and unsafe handling, the manufacturer's recommendations for your vehicle should be followed in selecting tires. Make sure you carry a spare tire that also fits the requirements for your vehicle.

The manufacturer's recommendations for tire pressure should also be followed. Either over- or under-inflating tires:

    Reduces traction, increases the likelihood of skidding, and degrades the handling characteristics of a vehicle.
    Leads to rapid tire wear.

Use the Abe Lincoln Test to discover if your tire tread is thick enough. If the tread reaches Abe's beard when you stick a penny in it, the tires are safe to drive.

Failing to keep wheels balanced and the suspension system properly aligned can lead to extremely rapid tire wear and may result in a blow-out. Worn components in the suspension and steering systems of your vehicle can cause you to lose control of your vehicle and cause rapid tire wear. The purpose of rotating tires is to prolong the life of the tire. Rotation should be done according to the intervals and procedures recommended by the manufacturer of your vehicle.

Peeling out on fast starts or spinning your tires creates poor acceleration, causes excessive tire wear, wastes fuel and can lead to a traffic citation for "exhibition of speed." Cornering at high speeds is dangerous and causes unnecessary wear on your tires.

If you have a tire blowout or lose a wheel while driving, you should:

    Hold the steering wheel tightly and steer straight ahead.
    Slow down gradually, taking your foot off the gas pedal slowly but without applying the brakes.
    Slow to a stop off the road, applying the brakes only when the car is almost stopped. Turn on your emergency flashers.
