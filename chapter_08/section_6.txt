Role Models

If you have a parent who tends to drive aggressively or be inattentive while driving, you should take steps to make sure that you do not pick up or express his or her poor driving habits. Some characteristics are passed genetically or through modeling others' behavior, and only proper training and practice can overcome poor traits that are passed on from your parents or from other adults who taught you how to drive.

Family (and friends) may not necessarily be good drivers; avoid using them as role models if they do not practice safe driving habits.

Become your own role model! The highways are full of opportunities to model safe, courteous driving behavior. Practice overcoming stress with positive solutions. The NHTSA has published a list of tips for keeping calm when traffic congestion slows everyone down and makes drivers feel frustrated and anxious. Here are ways to steer clear of road rage if you get bogged down in commuter traffic.

    Leave extra time for your trip
    Don't drive distracted
    Relax with calming music
    Drive the speed limit
    Try telecommuting
    Use public transportation
    Move closer to your job
