Knowing and Correctly Applying the Rules of the Road

A major responsibility of motor vehicle operators is to understand and follow the rules of the road that protect all drivers. There is a lawful, correct, safe procedure for every driving situation, and it's your obligation to know and practice those rules at all times

Rules of the road cover correct use of all lanes, starting and completing turns, passing other vehicles, dealing with dangerous situations, knowing who has the right-of-way under all circumstances, and adjusting your driving for special road conditions. These will be covered in detail in Unit 11, The Road.
