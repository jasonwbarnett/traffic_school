Drivers and Pedestrians

DMV Image Motorists are responsible to ensure the safety of pedestrians by respecting their right-of-way At intersections where streets join at approximate right angles, pedestrians have the right-of-way whether or not the crosswalks are marked by painted white lines. For the safety of anyone crossing the street, STOP, regardless of whether or not the pedestrian is following the rules. Drivers must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians who are crossing the roadway within a marked or unmarked crosswalk at an intersection.

Drivers must give the right-of-way to any pedestrians using a guide dog or carrying a white cane, no matter where they decide to cross the street. Only blind or legally (nearly) blind persons are allowed to carry a white cane. Pedestrians with white canes or seeing eye dogs always have the right-of-way.

Use extra caution when driving a hybrid or electric vehicle near pedestrians who may not hear your vehicle because it operates almost silently.

Do not drive on a sidewalk, except if you are crossing to enter or exit an alley or a driveway. Do not place pedestrians in danger by stopping in the middle of a crosswalk. Allow older and disabled pedestrians and pedestrians with children enough time to cross the street.

Treat all people near roadways as pedestrians, including highway and roadway workers, which include any city and/or county employees, city and/or county contractors and their employees, and Department of Transportation contractors and their employees. There are increased penalties for assault and battery crimes committed against highway workers engaged in the performance of their duties. When such a battery is committed and the person committing the offense knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a highway worker engaged in the performance of his or her duties, the offense shall be punished by a fine, or by imprisonment, or by both. So, make sure you slow down!
