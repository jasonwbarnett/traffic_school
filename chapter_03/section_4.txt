Courteous Driving

If every driver remembered the golden rule of driving, "Drive the way you want others to drive", there would be fewer accidents on our highways today. The courteous driver considers how their actions will affect the other drivers on the road and always makes an effort to be aware of what other cars are doing as well. Always remember to:

    Signal your turns
    Gradually change lanes well before making a turn
    Make your stops smoothly
    Leave plenty of space between your car and the car in front of you
    Use your horn sparingly
    Slow when you approach a yellow light, and do not attempt to speed through a red light
