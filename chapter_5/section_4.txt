Hydroplaning

If you've ever seen a "hydrofoil" boat cruising in a harbor, you have seen the principle of hydroplaning in action. You may have been in the same situation at some point in your driving history - driving without knowing that your vehicle was riding on a cushion of water. It occurs very easily in wet weather. When you drive at a fairly high rate of speed, such as highway speeds, water begins to collect in front of and under the tires faster than the treads can channel it away. When hydroplaning occurs, your vehicle actually rides on a film of water and road oils. This condition is at its worst when rain first begins to fall and the road oils exude from the pavement in the greatest amounts.

With hydroplaning, your vehicle is "skating" on a cushion of air with oil and water underneath - not the best conditions for traction and control. With a sudden gust of wind, a slight over-correction of steering, a minor curve in the road, you are out of control.

As a precaution, slow down when it starts to rain, and drive five to ten miles slower than you normally would if the road were dry. As a rule of thumb, do not wait to "feel" your vehicle hydroplaning. In rainy weather, automatically reduce speed, allowing your tires to have traction.

If you feel your vehicle start to hydroplane, indicated by a lessening sense of control in the steering wheel, take your foot off the accelerator and reduce your speed gradually. Do not step on the brake, because it will throw you into a skid. As your vehicle slows, the tires will begin to grip the road, regaining traction with the pavement under the water, and the hydroplaning will be over. You will again have normal control of your vehicle.
