It's not rocket science, but you do have to pay attention...

In order to be awarded credit for attending this course you must complete all units of curriculum and then pass the final exam. The final exam will include questions from each of the units, so we suggest paying close attention to all course material. If you are mentally alert and fully engaged in learning, you will retain the information you'll need to become a better driver and pass the test.

The Final Exam

The final exam consists of 25 multiple choice questions. You will have 60 minutes to complete the exam. It is an open book test, meaning you may refer back to the course material at any time during the exam. You must score at least 70% in order to pass the exam. If you do not pass the exam the first time you take it, you may re-take the exam one additional time. If you should fail to score 70% or more on the second attempt, you may re-enroll in another Traffic Violator School class.

DMV Course Evaluation Form

After you have taken the final exam you will be asked to complete a brief evaluation form. Please take the time to fill out this form as we encourage feedback of any kind! Your comments will be forwarded to the California DMV so that they may improve the quality of this program.
