Unit 8 - Road Rage

Aggressive driving is often referred to as "road rage". Road rage happens when one driver reacts negatively to another driver. Angry drivers may lash out at other drivers, their vehicles, and/or pedestrians. Even innocent bystanders can become the victims of someone else's aggressive behavior. Road rage is dangerous to drivers, passengers and pedestrians.

According to Wikipedia, the term road rage "...originated in 1987-1988, when a series of freeway shootings occurred on the 405, 110 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles. The AAA Motor Club began educating its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures."

The U.S. Highway Safety Office reports that each year, tens of thousands of automobile accidents can be linked directly to the expression of road rage and aggressive driving.

Road rage has also been the subject of recent studies investigating the causes and effects of aggressive driving. Discovering the psychological and environmental factors that trigger aggressive behavior on the road can help us understand how to deal with it. Learning how to handle road rage and take responsibility for your behavior can help you sidestep the trauma of getting involved with an aggressive road rage incident.
