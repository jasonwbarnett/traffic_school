Eating While Driving

Have you ever tried to open a can of soda while driving on the freeway? You would have looked at the can (a visual distraction), taken at least one hand off the wheel to pop the tab (a manual distraction) and most likely thought about how the soda would taste (a cognitive distraction.) While tipping the soda can to your lips, you probably wouldn't have been able to see the road clearly. Next time you are tempted, think about whether drinking that can of soda is worth risking your life.

Eating or drinking in your vehicle while you are driving is a serious form of distraction. While you are looking at, handling, tasting and thinking about your food, you are not focusing on your driving. Eating and drinking are complex sensory-motor activities, and as such, they qualify as high-risk driver distractions.

Eating often involves opening plastic containers, jars, bags or packages, which can be difficult enough even in the kitchen, let alone while trying to steer a motor vehicle! If an apple rolls off the seat and you try to grab it before it hits the floor, you may unintentionally jerk the wheel, swerve into the other lane and collide with another vehicle. If you have ever spilled hot coffee on your lap, you know how distracting that can be! Children are also prone to spilling while eating in the car, and as a parent, it's hard to resist the urge to clean up their mess.

When you are hungry or thirsty, please stop the vehicle and allow yourself the time and space to eat and drink without the risk of getting involved in an accident.
