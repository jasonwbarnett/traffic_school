Grooming While Driving

Driving a motor vehicle is a task which requires coordination of many faculties of your mind and body. Adding other tasks on top of one that already requires your full attention, physical reflexes, motor coordination and ability to make split-second decisions is a formula for disaster. Taking care of personal hygiene and grooming should never be done while driving.

It may seem innocent enough to check out how your hair looks before you arrive at work or while driving to a party, but as soon as you look at yourself in the mirror, you move the focus of your attention off the complex duties of driving. And if your hair looks bad, you will probably want to do something about it!

When you groom yourself while driving, you take your eyes off the road and use your hands to do other things besides controlling the steering wheel. If you're like most people, you will probably use your comb or brush until you achieve the desired effect and your hair looks more presentable. For those moments, your driving persona takes a back seat to your well-groomed image, and your accident risk escalates.

Driving is already a form of multitasking, so don't add the distraction of other, unrelated tasks like putting on makeup. Use your makeup mirror at home - before you leave the house, not while you are in transit. You'll probably be more pleased with the results! Don't try applying lipstick or eyeliner while you are steering an SUV in city traffic. At best, you'll smear your makeup, and at worst, you'll end up in a crash.
