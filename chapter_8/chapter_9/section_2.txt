Keep Your Eyes on the Road

Vision plays a significant role in the steps by which you detect and avoid a hazardous situation. These include:

    The transmission of a visual image to your brain
    The comparison of this image with learned rules and experiences
    A decision to take an action
    The transmission through your nervous system of commands to your hands and feet to turn the steering wheel, apply brakes, accelerate or decelerate, use the horn, and so on.

When your vision is diverted from the roadway, information that may alert you to danger is temporarily unavailable to your eyes and brain. When this happens, you are not able to detect a hazard and decide how to act defensively. Anything that distracts your eyes from the road impairs your ability to drive safely.

Good vision is key to being able to stop your vehicle in time to avoid an accident. If you are looking at a road map instead of the road, you may fail to spot and react to a hazard coming from the left or right of your vehicle. You may fail to see and obey a stop light suspended over an intersection you're traveling through. You may weave off the highway while negotiating a curve, or drive too close to a car parked at the side of the road.
