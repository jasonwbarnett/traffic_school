Intoxication

Nothing has the potential to cause more tragedy and heartbreak in a matter of seconds than driving while intoxicated. Intoxication literally means "to poison yourself." Intoxication is the poisoning of the human system with alcohol or other drugs, creating excitement or stupefaction. This results in an impairment of judgment, reason, and psychomotor skills, all of which are essential to driving safely. Driving while under the influence of an intoxicant is the same as playing "Russian Roulette." There is a bullet in the chamber; and if it does not kill you one time, it is likely to do so eventually.

This section is intended to teach you how alcohol affects the human brain and body. It should motivate you to take the subject of "driving under the influence" seriously. Besides creating emotional stress, risking the possibility of getting arrested and going to jail, and losing your license, driving while intoxicated may lead to the possibility of killing innocent people - and/or yourself!
