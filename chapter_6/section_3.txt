Blind Spots

The way you position your vehicle in relation to other vehicles is crucial to defensive driving. You must make certain that you can see everyone and everyone can see you. Don't ride in another vehicle's blind spot, and try to change position if you notice that someone is riding in yours. If you stay in the blind spot of another vehicle, you interfere with the driver's ability to take evasive action in a risky situation.

Drivers of passenger vehicles often assume that truck drivers have an excellent view of the road simply because they ride in a higher seat. Remember that not only do trucks have extra-large front windshields and mirrors, they also have extra-large blind spots. The rule of thumb is that if you can see a truck driver in his or her rear view mirror, he or she can see you. If you cannot see the truck driver in the truck's rear view mirror, the driver cannot see you. A truck's blind spots are known as the "No Zone".

If you have any doubt as to whether or not the driver can see you, the rule of "assume invisibility" is always the safest choice. Basically, this rule states that when you are driving, you are invisible to other drivers. Never make a maneuver that depends on the safety of another driver seeing you, and then make the maneuver with the assumption he does see you. Unless you can make eye contact and are certain you have been seen, you must assume that you are invisible and maneuver accordingly.

Blind Spots at Intersections

There are many additional things that can block the view of your car at intersections. In addition to your normal blind spots, be aware of buildings, trees or signs that can make it difficult for others to see you, of for you to see others when stopped or passing through an intersection. When you notice objects that hide your view from other drivers, slow down and be prepared to brake if an unseen vehicle or pedestrian crosses your path.
