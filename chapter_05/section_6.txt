Many roads may not be properly maintained, and there may be sharp curves, bumps, and uneven surface conditions that can cause a person to lose control of his or her vehicle. Due to many unmarked shoulders, loose gravel and sand may cause a driver to skid and lose control of his or her vehicle. Small towns are full of roadside stands, gas stations, and country stores. A driver must watch for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

Soft Shoulders

If the edge of the road, known as the shoulder, has loose dirt or other soft material, it is dangerous. Generally, soft shoulders are found in rural areas, but they can be anywhere. Soft roadway shoulders are deceiving. The surface may appear firm; but when it is driven on, it can cause the vehicle to swerve out of control as the tires sink into the roadway. The tires may even stick. Sometimes the soft shoulder is a temporary condition due to construction or other short-term situations. In those cases, the road should have warning signs to alert drivers.

Drop-Offs

Drop-offs can occur when wind, water, or construction erodes shoulder areas. If your wheels leave the pavement and hit either a soft shoulder or a drop-off, DO NOT APPLY YOUR BRAKES. Braking will cause the right and left wheels to slow unevenly due to reduced traction on the right wheels. Grip the steering wheel firmly, slow down by taking your foot off the accelerator, and steer straight ahead. When the vehicle has slowed significantly, return to the pavement by turning sharply to the left when it is safe to do so. "When it is safe to do so" means when turning sharply, the turn won't throw you into another hazard, such as an on-coming car.

Irregular Pavement

When the roadway is stony, gravelly, has loose rocks or gravel on it, or is deteriorating or has puddles or leaves (especially wet leaves), friction between tires and pavement is impaired, therefore, reducing braking ability. Drive just as if you were on very icy or snowy pavement.
