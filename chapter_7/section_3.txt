Traffic Safety on our National Highways

In data reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were 30,797 fatal crashes in the United States in 2009. This represents 16.13 fatalities per every 100,000 licensed drivers in the country. Fifty-nine percent of fatal crashes involved only one vehicle, as compared with 33% of injury crashes and 31% of property-damage-only crashes. Of 33,828 people who were killed in those crashes, 17,640 were drivers, 6,770 were passengers, 4,482 were motorcyclists, 4,722 were pedestrians or pedal cyclists, and 214 were "unknown" victims.

Types of violation

Speeding is a factor in about one-third of all fatal crashes, killing nearly 900 Americans every month. In 2009, speeding was a factor in 31 percent of motor vehicle crash deaths, killing 10,591 people across the country. Based on a nationally representative sample of police-reported crashes, in 2009 speed was a contributing factor in about 17 percent of property-damage-only crashes and 22 percent of crashes involving injuries or fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the economic cost of speed-related crashes is more than $40 billion each year.

In a high-speed crash, a passenger vehicle is subjected to forces so severe that the vehicle structure cannot withstand the force of the crash and maintain survival space in the occupant compartment. Likewise, as crash speeds get very high, restraint systems such as airbags and safety belts cannot keep the forces on occupants below severe injury levels.

Speed influences the risk of crashes and crash injuries in three basic ways:

    It increases the distance a vehicle travels from the time a driver detects an emergency to the time the driver reacts.
    It increases the distance needed to stop a vehicle once the driver starts to brake.
    It increases the crash energy by the square of the speeds. For example, when impact speed increases from 40 to 60 mph (a 50 percent increase), the energy that needs to be managed increases by 125 percent.

After the United States Congress repealed the National Maximum Speed Limit in 1995, states began to raise their speed limits. As travel speeds increased on Interstate highways, traffic fatalities historically increased in states that raised their speed limits. (IIHS, 1999) In the 24 states that raised their speed limits in late 1995 and in 1996, fatalities on Interstate highways increased 15 percent. Deaths on other roadways where speed limits were not raised were unchanged. (IIHS, 1998)

A 2009 study examining the long-term effects of the 1995 repeal of the national speed limit found a 3 percent increase in road fatalities attributable to higher speed limits on all road types, with the highest increase of 9 percent on rural interstates. The authors estimated that 12,545 deaths were attributed to increases in speed limits across the US between 1995 and 2005.

Drivers in the United States kill and injury one another more often by excessive speeding and by driving under the influence of intoxicants. Both of these most frequent causes of accidental death and injury on the road are completely preventable. Both are direct results of behavior on the part of drivers that can be avoided by two simple remedies: always drive the speed limit, and never drive if you have been drinking.

Alcohol Involvement

Alcohol involvement and speeding often go hand-in-hand. In 1998, 43 percent of drivers with a 0.10 BAC or higher who were involved in fatal crashes were speeding, compared with 14 percent of the sober (0.00 BAC) drivers in fatal crashes. (NHTSA, 1999)

In 2009, there were 10,839 fatalities in crashes involving a driver with a BAC of .08 or higher - 32 percent of total traffic fatalities for the year.

Traffic fatalities in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes decreased by 7.4 percent from 11,711 in 2008 to 10,839 in 2009. The alcohol-impaired-driving fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) decreased to 0.36 in 2009 from 0.39 in 2008. An average of one alcohol-impaired-driving fatality occurred every 48 minutes in 2009.

Of the 10,839 people who died in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes in 2009, 7,281 (67%) were drivers with a BAC of .08 or higher. The remaining fatalities consisted of 2,891 (27%) motor vehicle occupants and 667 (6%) non-occupants.

In 2009, a total of 1,314 children age 14 and younger were killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes. Of those 1,314 fatalities, 181 (14%) occurred in alcohol-impaired driving crashes. Out of those 181 deaths, 92 (51%) were occupants of a vehicle with a driver who had a BAC level of .08 or higher, and another 27 children (15%) were pedestrians or pedal cyclists struck by drivers with a BAC of .08 or higher.

The rate of alcohol impairment among drivers involved in fatal crashes in 2009 was four times higher at night than during the day (37% versus 9%). In 2009, 16 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes during the week were alcohol-impaired, compared to 31 percent on weekends.

Time of day

In statistics reported by the NHTSA for 2009, more fatal crashes occurred across the county on Saturdays and Sundays from midnight to 2:59 am. A total of 4,988 crashes occurred between 6 pm to 8:59 pm, 4,944 crashes occurred between 3 pm to 5:59 pm and 4,359 crashes occurred between 9 pm and 11:59 pm. Accidents involving fatalities were thus far more likely to occur at night than during daytime hours.

Age and gender

Young drivers (under 30 years old) are more likely to speed than other drivers. Of all drivers involved in fatal crashes, young males are most likely to speed. Statistics reported for 2009 by the National Safety Council show that 32,807 male drivers caused fatal crashes, while 11,825 female drivers caused fatal crashes. The leading cause of death for 15-20 year olds are vehicle crashes. Vehicle crashes make up approximately one-third of all deaths for this age group. More crashes occur when passengers, usually other teens, are in the vehicle with a teen driver. Two out of three teens die as passengers in a vehicle driven by another teen.

The relative proportion of speeding-related fatal crashes decreases with increasing driver age. Another way to describe this is that drivers grow older, they are more likely to drive the posted or speed limit.
