Negligent Operator Treatment System (NOTS)

One of the most important control measures developed by the Department of Motor Vehicles is the Negligent Operator Treatment System (NOTS). Since 1915, when California first began to issue driver's licenses, the DMV has had some responsibility for highway safety through its licensing authority. Through the years, this obligation has been re-emphasized many times in legislative actions. The enforcement procedures given to the DMV include suspension, revocation, and cancellation of a driver's license.

Driving is like golf - the lower score wins. All moving traffic violations and crashes have the potential to damage your driving record. The DMV has a point system to gauge the quality of your driving; and the more points you accumulate, the more negligent you are considered to be. Both the DMV and your insurance company use the point system to determine penalties.

Most traffic violations and minor crashes will count ONE point against a driver's license. TWO points are assigned for the following:

    Reckless driving.
    Vehicular manslaughter
    Driving over 100 miles per hour.
    Illegal transport of explosives.
    Causing injury or death while avoiding a law enforcement officer.
    Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
    Hitting an unattended vehicle without notifying the owner.
    Driving on the wrong side of a divided highway.
    Causing property damage, injury, or death and then fleeing the scene without reporting to traffic law enforcement authorities.
    Speed contests (drag racing) on public streets.
